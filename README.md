## Description

In this project I attempted to replicate the user interface of the photography website <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash.com</a> The website includes a view for a large screen, medium screen, and a small screen.

There is no functionality, since I was mainly trying to copy the look and responsiveness of the website. Below is a screenshot of the unsplash homepage.
